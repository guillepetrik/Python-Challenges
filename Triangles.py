# Triangle Quest Challenges
# Number 1

for i in range(1, int(input())):
    print((pow(10,i)//9)*i)

# Overall, the code generates and prints a pattern of numbers based on the input value, following the described mathematical sequence.

# Number 2

for i in range(1, int(input())+1):
    print((pow(10,i)//9)**2)

# The code generates and prints a pattern of numbers where each number consists of repeating digits, and the pattern is formed by squaring the repeated digits. 
# The number of repetitions increases with each iteration of the loop.
